                        <h3>1. The State Of Art</h3>
                        <p align="justify" style="line-height: 0.8cm;">GPS is no more bizarre to us. It plays a pivotal role in helping us to locate the specific streets and areas almost everywhere. It tends to be said that GPS is one of the most amazing innovations that humans have created. So, what precisely is GPS? We can understand that GPS (global positioning system), is a satellite-based route framework consisting of an organization of 24 satellites circling the earth consistently. It resembles a watchman flying around the earth and has a mission of guarding like a camera. Even though there is a variety of versions, they work as a whole and not individually. Moreover, the way GPS works are quite simple: For example, there are three fixed points on the map, GPS will measure the distance between you and each point; then it will draw three circles with the radius equal to the distance, and finally, the point at which the three circles meet is where you are. In that way, GPS can almost identify your exact location.  There is no limitation of this system, GPS works in every single climate condition, anyplace on the planet, 24 hours per day. The most famous and familiar application using GPS is definitely Google Maps. We use this app on a daily basis to help us in finding ways to a destination.  It identifies our current location, anticipates the time is taken and the distance, tracks our route, and guides us to the address given.</p>

                        <h3>The Future</h3>
                        <p align="justify" style="line-height: 0.8cm;">In the future, the GPS will definitely be upgraded to be faster and more accurate with more functions. “To the computers of the world, at least, our locations may be defined not by a street address, a city, and a state, but by a longitude and a latitude.”, (The Global Positioning System: The Path From Research to Human Benefit (1996), p. 7, para. 10). I also expect that not only our phones or smart devices have GPS but almost all of our belongings will be equipped with this system and it will be connected to our phones. By that, we can see where our stuff is and easily find it. GPS might not only be used for finding and guiding, but it will also be applied in space in order to track other satellites or space crafts. Another prediction from me is GPS might also be used by the government in order to track their citizens instead of CCTVs.</p>

                        <h3>What Is The Impact To The World?</h3>
                        <p align="justify" style="line-height: 0.8cm;">For the science that says, GPS has carried numerous advantages to the universe of researchers with specific preferences and positions since the beginning. For them, the greatest advantage is that they have an incredible apparatus to go with them to find new things in outer space. As referenced above, having these things will help us make incredible steps in the space field. For instance, GPS recipients filled an alternate need—to follow geologic cycles that occur on much more slow scales, for example, the rate at which Earth's extraordinary crustal plates help to predict Earthquakes ( Alexandra, W 2019). Concerning us, I think it mostly brings immense pay for technology drivers. It is the essential platform for the most modern ride-hailing applications such as Uber, Grab, and Go Viet. Current vehicle global positioning systems frequently use GPS innovation to find vehicles, yet different kinds of auto-situating advancements may likewise be utilized. Vehicle following is one of the most progressive in the coordination business. The benefit of these tracking tools is that different travelers utilizing the administration will be protected when their area is turned on and others can without much of a stretch track them to guarantee security as far as client care. Concerning vehicle drivers, they can abbreviate travel time as GPS can help them discover alternate ways which can avoid gridlock and this is a win-win scenario for both customers and drivers. Furthermore, Street length count encourages them to think about the expense to try not to swindle each other in the spending issue and protect the interests of customers. Interesting, as far as my concern, I do not find any job that can be replaced by the existence of GPS. However, carrying a GPS equipped device also means that we are under the supervision 24/7 anywhere we go.</p>

                        <h3>How Will GPS Affect Me?</h3>
					    <p align="justify" style="line-height: 0.8cm;">In my daily and other youngster’s lives, finding and discovering new things is no more unusual to us. We use GPS to discover new places and search for a way to get there. For example, thanks to GPS and Google Maps, I found a café in district 1 and now it has become a natural spot for me to clear the night-time of work. Furthermore, for late journeys, I for the most part turn on my location with the goal that everybody can know where I am to guarantee wellbeing just as for my family to know the area and have the option to react conveniently if something dangerous occurs. Other than me, there are likewise individuals who use GPS to play social games like kindling, Snapchat, … what's more, it functions admirably for them. In my perspective, the new application will be considerably more helpful for me if another GPS device is created and effectively dispatched onto a spaceship, everything from tracking to discovering is a basic problem it can ascertain and give a more precise outcome. GPS has become an instrument that everybody needs and can use in each circumstance it's up to them. Without it, I figure this world would get old and science couldn't arrive at an advanced age.</p>
