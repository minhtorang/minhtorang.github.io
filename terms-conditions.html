                        <h3>The State Of Art</h3>
                        <p style="line-height: 0.8cm;" align="justify">AR has become more and more popular in today's world. It is used in a vast of fields, including entertainment, education, health care, etc. The most commonly known application of AR is probably building games. A really famous example that applied AR technology is Pokémon Go. Regarding health care, AR enhances the studying of human anatomy of doctors and help them to diagnose symptoms more easily. For other fields such as education, AR provides a more enjoyable environment and effective teaching methods to students and children. Manufacturing and the military also use AR in order to increase productivity and accuracy. There are bunches of devices around us that include AR technology and I think it is going to rise in the near future. More and more developers and technology companies are paying a huge amount of money and time on AR. The reason that makes AR becoming one of the favorite technologies in several industries is that it can illustrate and bring a more realistic view of an object to the users. Through that, they can have a clear image of one thing and that can make their work become much faster and more convenient. It also helps the users to memorize small details and make them feel more interested while using a device or learning new things.  </p>

                    <div class="text-container">
                        <h3>The Future</h3>
                        <p style="line-height: 0.8cm;" align="justify">AR is rapidly growing day by day and is expected to become more wildly used in our life. Although there are many applications using AR, they are not commonly used and still new to many people. An article has written ‘Thanks to the Pokémon Go craze of 2016, most people think of augmented reality (AR) as a sort of modernized scavenger hunt – an interesting but limited new technology with little to no application outside of the mobile gaming world.’ (The Multifaceted Future Of Augmented Reality, para. 1). Since AR brings a more convenient and efficient working, studying, and living environment for humans, I believe in the next few years, our lives will be involved with devices using AR. In education, instead of imagining, students can have a better understanding of the lecture by showing them how the thing they just learn actually looks like in real life and how it is applied. There might also be a device which can help student and children learning things by placing the camera in front of an object and the information about it will pop up. Another scenario I think of is companies will integrate AR in demonstrating their products to the customers. And through that, customers can know whether that product is suitable or not. For example, if they are buying clothes or accessories, they can “try on” the clothes by having the clothes on their body through the camera to see if they fit them; or if the customers buying furniture, AR can help them to put the stuff in the place they want in advanced to see if that furniture is suitable. This technique can be applied to buying almost everything in life. One more thing I suppose can be done in the future using AR is people can talk to each other through their virtual 3D models. When calling a person, a 3D graphic of that person will appear in real life, not on the screen, just like that person is standing there talking to us. I think it is not only applied for communicating but other fields will also use this technique to give a clearer demonstration of their industry. </p>

                        <h3>What Is The Impact To The World?</h3>
                        <p style="line-height: 0.8cm;" align="justify">AR and VR could have as big an impact on society as the internet; that’s the bold’, claimed by Kelly Goetsch (The impact of AR and VR will be as big as the internet, para. 1). I have a really big expectation on how amazing AR can change the world, so I completely agree with the statement. There are hundreds of things that AR can do to our lives and I believe it will improve the level of convenience and productivity in the way we live and work. Our lives’ quality will definitely turn into a whole new page if we apply this technology correctly. Moreover, many enterprises will invest in AR and that will also increase the number of jobs related to AR such as graphic designers, software developers, etc. That also means the future IT industry will require developers and engineers to have general knowledge about AR and the number of people studying IT will increase dramatically. Although AR will bring a host of benefits to us, however, it might decrease a minor number of labor jobs. An example is customers can have a semi-real demonstration and experience of a product, they might not want to go and buy it directly from the store anymore and that might cause to the reduction of shop assistants. Another downside of this technology is it might create a gap among people because if we can see each other through our virtual 3D graphics, which are exactly the same as us, then some people might find it is no use going out and seeing each other in real life. Despite the fact that AR is helpful, it can also cause addiction. We have already seen how the internet and social media affect some people negatively, there is no doubt that this new and interesting technology can cause the same things. There are many incidents that happened by Pokémon Go’s players because they are too focus on the game and forget the reality. If more and equipment devices involving AR, there is a high chance that many people will rely heavily on the advantages brought by this technology.</p>

                        <h3>How Will AR Affect Me?</h3>
                        <p style="line-height: 0.8cm;" align="justify">As mentioned above, AR will definitely improve others’ lives, and mine is not an exception. Life is about choices, and I was never good at making choices. It can even take me hours to hours just to answer these questions: “What pattern of that shirt should I buy?”, “Which color, red or blue?”, “What should I wear today?”, “Will that look good on me?” and bunches of other questions. By having an AR app that allows me to “try on” or have a clear demonstration of one thing, it can save me quite a large amount of time scrolling up and down to decide which one I should buy, and I can use that time to do my assignment instead. It might also change the way I, and other teenagers, entertain and learn. My friends and I will hang out less than normal but that does not mean we reduce our contact with each other. For instance, my friends usually come over to practice dancing with me, however, with the help of AR, we can still do that with enjoyment without riding for a far distance and under uncomfortable weather. I think AR can help me a lot, however, for my parents, it will not be really useful and might cause some inconvenience for them. My parents are from the previous generation and they do not know much about technology so it will be difficult for them to get used to new innovations. However, whatever AR does to our lives, I think they will still be more interesting. </p>
