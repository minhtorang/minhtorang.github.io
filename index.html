Since I am usually reserved in front of strangers, I would love to work with teammates who are friendly, funny and more of the extrovert side so that he and she can strike up a conversation first. If that person is shy or too cold, I think it will be kind of difficult for us to communicate as well as work together. Besides, I am a person who usually lets my feelings and emotions control my behaviors and words when I am not in a good mood. </p>

Therefore, I hope my teammates is a calm and logical person. In that way, it can be easier for us when dealing with conflicts without affecting our relationships. Moreover, if standing in front of a problem, we can contribute useful ideas to each other since we observe and process things in different aspects. Last but not least, I want to work with people who are responsible for their work. They do not need to be extremely intelligent or good, but they have to finish their tasks on time and take their work seriously. Since I am already not good at controlling my feelings, stuff like irresponsibility or laziness can make me unpleasant and lead to unwanted conversations that can break our relationships. </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 15px;margin-top: 20px">In conclusion, my ideal teammate must have these three personalities:</p>

We can talk to each other comfortably and that reduces the awkwardness and seriousness when working together. Although Huy is a boy,he can be calm when dealing with hard situations. Therefore, he can help me to moderate my feelings. Not only is he responsible for his work but also enthusiastic about helping teammates. I have been quite struggling when dealing with assignments, however, Huy has helped me a lot. </p>

                        <p align="justify" style="color: white;">On my first day at RMIT, I was overwhelmed by how enormous the school is. Even though I had come to visit the university a few times and took a campus tour, I still could not identify what room is where. After almost two months of studying here, I am sometimes still struggling with finding rooms or distinguishing between building 1 and 2. I believe this not only happens for me but a majority of RMIT freshmen have problems in finding ways in our school. A friend of mine even had to skip a test because he could not find where the room was. Due to all the reasons above, I want to create an app that can help students or anyone new to RMIT to find their way around here, and it is called "RMIT guider".</p>

                <p align="justify" style="margin-right: 55px; margin-left: 15px; color: white;" >RMIT guider is an app using augmented reality (AR) technology and AI to guide and help people to find their way to the location they want in RMIT. The app will give clear instructions on how to get to a place as well as provide some general information about that room such as name, function, capacity, or interesting facts if has. The user only needs a smartphone with a camera then they can start their adventure in exploring RMIT university.</p>

                            There will be a small search box for the user to type in the location where they want to go. It can be a room number (e.g. 2.2.03), the name of the place (e.g. Melbourne Theater, Canteen), a building (e.g. Build 1) or a specific thing (e.g. Vending machine, ATM machine). Besides, if you have no idea about the name or number of that room, you can put in the search box what you want to do then the app can give suggestions to you. For instance, if you want to find a room to study, type in “study room” then the app will recommend you several rooms that are suitable to study. Another example is if you want to find a store which sells curry in RMIT, just type in “curry food”. The app will search if there is any store in RMIT that matches with your requirements then it will suggest you. Since this app stored information about a location, it is not difficult for it to identify a place based on what you provided. Once you finished choosing where you want to go, the app will give instructions right on the screen for you to get there from where you are standing at that moment. For example, if you are standing in front of an intersection, an arrow will pop up on the screen and tell you to turn left, turn right or go straight depending on where that location is.

For example, when I am holding my phone camera in front of the library, several boxes will appear on the screen like the picture beside. This can provide basic knowledge about that location for the user so they can know where they are and where to go if they need something. Moreover, the user can know what is allowed and not allowed in that place. Like in some rooms in our school, we are not allowed to bring food and drink inside; if we want to enter a lab, we need to wear sneakers, not flip-flops; and some places are not allowed after a specific time.

It also requires cloud-computing to store information about the places. Besides, this app is a location-based application so it will need an accelerometer or a digital compass to identify the location of the user. Lastly, to create this app, I will need an at least intel core i5 computer with 8GB RAM in order to handle these programs, and I need also a graphic card.  </p>

They also let me know how future users think of and what they want from my app. I do agree with the feedbacks that this app needs more effective and interesting features in order to attract users and maintain long-term use. Since this app will be mainly used by newbies, so it will be less useful when the students can remember the locations and places on the campus. Unlike Google Maps, the total area which is covered by this app is just RMIT university so it might not be widely used. In order to make users stick with the app for a long period, I should include some more features such as a small game. This game will require the user to go to a specific location in the campus to collect small gifts on the screen, it is somehow similar to Pokémon Go. Once they can collect a suitable number of virtual gifts, they can use them to exchange gifts in real life such as lanyards. Another feature I might put in is voice-recording and voice-instructing from the app. Not every time the user can look at their phone, and it might also cause some incidents if the user focuses too much on their phones while walking around the school. Therefore, I think interaction through voice can be more convenient for the user as well as support users who have a problem in seeing. I think Linh’s idea about having music played in the app is worth considering so I might put in more sound effects and animations in order to prevent boredom from users. </p>

                <p align="justify">Since we are living in the 4.0 era, so all most everything in our lives is connected by technology. Our information is stored in smart devices or a database system; the lighting system of our house can be controlled by a smartphone; and sooner or later, technology will help us to do almost everything in life. Therefore, it would be really dangerous if our system is hacked and controlled by outsiders. To prevent that from happening, we need security specialists. Their jobs are building security systems and protecting a system from the attack of hackers or natural incidents. They will have to ensure the system is running probably, anticipate and eliminate any threats to it as well as prevent information to be leaked out. If you are using an automotive car, a security specialist will have to build a security system to protect your car from being hacked and controlled by others.</p>

                <p align="justify">A Security specialist associates with many other IT professionals such as software engineers, software developers, security analysts, etc. in order to build a proper system. They usually launch meetings to discuss together since there are many parts of a product and each is built by a different IT professional. The security specialist also works with a project manager who gives directives about what tasks need to be done or improved. Last but not least, they have to contact their customers to receive feedback and know if the product satisfies the customer’s demands or not and what needs to be changed.</p>

                <p>From the response I receive in the interview, discussing with the customer is the most challenging part of this job. There might be some tricky demands from the customer that cannot be fulfilled, and it is difficult to please them all the time. The conversation can sometimes contain sensitive information and turns awkward. Since he could not give more details about it, that is all I can know. </p>
